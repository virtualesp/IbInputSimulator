# IbInputSimulator
A library for simulating keyboard and mouse input with drivers.

## Supported drivers
- [Logitech Gaming Software](https://support.logi.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360025298053-Logitech-Gaming-Software)

  No Logitech hardware required. However, in the new versions of LGS, the mouse driver has been removed ([#8](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/IbInputSimulator/issues/8)). You can install [v9.02.65](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/IbLogiSoftExt/releases/download/v0.1/LGS.v9.02.65_x64.exe) to make the mouse driver available.

  e.g. `IbSendInit("Logitech")`

- [Logitech G HUB](https://www.logitechg.com/innovation/g-hub.html)

  No Logitech hardware required. However, in the new versions of G HUB (≥ 2022.3.2300), the mouse driver has been removed ([#8](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/IbInputSimulator/issues/8)). Unfortunately, there is currently no known way to install an old version.

  e.g. `IbSendInit("Logitech")`
  
- [Logitech G HUB](https://www.logitechg.com/innovation/g-hub.html) new

  No Logitech hardware required. Works with new versions of the G HUB. Mouse input stops working after the first reboot following the installation of the G HUB. To restore mouse functionality, you may need to reinstall G HUB with "Transfer my current settings" turned off. ([#8](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/IbInputSimulator/issues/8))

  e.g. `IbSendInit("LogitechGHubNew")`

- [Razer Synapse 3](https://www.razer.com/synapse-3)

  In the new versions of Razer Synapse, Razer hardware is required to make the driver available. The old versions do not require Razer hardware, but the online installer of Razer Synapse can only install the newest version. To install an old version manually, see [#7](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/IbInputSimulator/issues/7) for details.

  e.g. `IbSendInit("Razer")`

- [MouClassInputInjection](https://github.com/Chaoses-Ib/MouClassInputInjection)

  e.g. `IbSendInit("MouClassInputInjection", 1, process_id)`

- [DD Virtual Mouse & Virtual Keyboard](https://github.com/ddxoft/master)

  May cause a blue screen; difficult to uninstall cleanly; need network.

  To use it, put the DLL (`DD94687.64.dll`/`DD64.dll`/`DDHID64.dll`) with your script file, and then:
  ```ahk
  IbSendInit("DD")
  ```
  or specify the DLL path when call IbSendInit:
  ```ahk
  IbSendInit("DD", 1, "C:\SomeDir\DD64.dll")
  ```

## Software compatibility
Software | SendInput | Logitech | Razer | MCII | DD | EDI | DM | Other
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Blade & Soul (Korean) <!--220703--> | | ✔️ | | | ❗ | ✔️ | ✔️ | ❌ SendInput hook
Genshin | [High](https://meta.appinn.net/t/topic/44865/10?u=chaoses_ib)

For SendInput, software with `High` indicates that the target process usually has a high integrity level, which may block SendInput due to UIPI. To put it simply, this means that you need to run the input simulator with administrator privileges.

## Supported languages
